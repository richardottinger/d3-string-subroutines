d3 String Manipulation Subroutines.

* Takes some repetitive simple string manipulation and encapsulate the details within a subroutine. 
* I prefer to use these subroutines while experimenting to help make my d3 programs more readable
* You may determine that these string subroutines are 
	* not necessary 
	* may make your program use more memory than desired 
		* since strings and arrays are being passed as arguments.  
	* In this case, 
		* convert back to using normal string manipulation 
			* instead of calling these subroutines to do it for you.
